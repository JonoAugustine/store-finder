# Store Finder

## [See Deployed Project](https://store-finder-app.herokuapp.com/)

A simple project I used to get more familiar with NodeJS, Express and Mongoose.
This webapp uses the MapBox API along with a MongoDB instance to store and present
locations on a map.

## Roadmap

- Mobile-friendlyness
